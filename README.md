## Introduction
This project involves analyzing ecommerce data to uncover insights and trends. The goal is to understand customer behavior, sales performance, and other key metrics. This project is part of the DEPI Diploma tasks.

## Data Collection
The data used in this project was collected from various sources including online transactions, customer reviews, and web analytics. The dataset used is `ecommerce_data.csv`.

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis. This was performed using Python in the Jupyter notebook `Task_9_Notebook.ipynb`.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to visualize and summarize the main characteristics of the data. This included generating plots and statistical summaries. The EDA was conducted in the Jupyter notebook `Task_9_Notebook.ipynb`.

## SQL Analysis
SQL queries were used to perform aggregated analysis on the data. The SQL script `Task_9_SQL.sql` includes queries for customer insights, product analysis, and time-based insights.

## Visualization
Visualizations were created using Matplotlib in the Jupyter notebook `Task_9_Notebook.ipynb`. These visualizations include bar charts, line charts, and pie charts to represent various aspects of the data.

## Conclusion
The analysis provided valuable insights into customer purchasing patterns and sales trends, which can be used to make informed business decisions.
